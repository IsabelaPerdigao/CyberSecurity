Passive Survey Technical Report 
Survey date: October 31, 2025Author: Isabela Perdigão 
Scope: Authorized passive reconnaissance, without execution of intrusive tests. Note: This document consolidates information obtained from public artifacts provided by the researcher. The report prioritizes technical analysis, evidence collected, and mitigation recommendations. No payload or exploit instruction is included.


1. Executive Summary
A passive survey was carried out on the domain [redacted], focusing on infrastructure mapping, analysis of public files and inspection of client-side resources.
The main findings indicate:
Exposure of administrative paths and sensitive files via robots.txt.
Indications of CMS (probable [redacted]) and public upload directories (/sites/default/files/).
Absence of CAA record in DNS (unrestricted certificate issuance).
Valid TLS certificates and Imperva-protected infrastructure (WAF/CDN).
Client-side scripts with potential risks of data exposure, dynamic execution, and weak consent and tracking configuration.
Overall Risk Rating

2. Methodology
Public Information Collection: WHOIS, DNS, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, TLS/SSL.
Parsing client-side code (JavaScript) from listed files.
No active testing, fuzzing, or exploration was performed.
Tools used: curl, whois, dig, manual inspection of JS and HTML.

3. Technical Findings (Summary and Prioritization)
FIND-001 — robots.txt Directives Exposing Administrative Paths
Description: The robots.txt file lists routes such as /admin/, /sites/default/files/, /README.md, among others, indicating potential sandboxes. Evidence:
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /sites/default/files/
Disallow: /README.md
Severity: LowRecommendation: Remove sensitive directories from the robots.txt and enforce authentication/authorization for administrative routes.

FIND-002 — Imperva-protected infrastructure (WAF/CDN)
Description: Nameservers point to [redacted], confirming the use of WAF/CDN. Evidence:ns1.a0. [redacted] — IP 192.2x.x.x.xSeverity: LowRecommendation: Review WAF policies and enforce MFA in the admin panel. Ensure no subdomain takeover.

FIND-003 — Absence of CAA (DNS) record
Description: No CAA records found. This allows certificate issuance by any CA. Evidence:CAA: NoSeverity: LowRecommendation: Configure CAA records to restrict certificate issuance to only the officially used CA.

FIND-004 — Indícios de CMS [redacted]
Description: Typical [redacted] directories and endpoints identified (/node, /taxonomy, /user/login). Evidence:
Disallow: /node
Disallow: /taxonomy
Disallow: /user/login
Severity: Low (medium potential if outdated versions). Recommendation: Confirm CMS version and modules; Apply hardening and patches.

FIND-005 — Accessible public sitemap
Description: https://www. [redacted]/rj/sitemap.xml contains full URLs, including internal routes. Severity: InformationalRecommendation: Ensure that the sitemap does not expose administrative endpoints or internal APIs.

FIND-006 — Public Upload Directory
Description: /sites/default/files/ indicates publicly accessible upload location. Severity: MediumRisk: Misconfigured upload may allow file execution or PII exposure. Recommendation:
Validate file type and MIME-type.
Store outside of webroot.
Apply security headers (e.g. Content-Disposition: attachment).

4. Client-Side (JS) Code Analysis
Several JavaScript scripts loaded on the frontend have been identified. No exploits were performed, only static analysis.
Examples of Evidence
1. Exposure of global variables:
[redacted]Data_6904ce6b54975.visitor_cpf = '';
[redacted]Data_6904ce6b54975.visitor_cnpj = '';
Risk: If dynamically populated, they can be read by malicious scripts (XSS). Recommendation: Store sensitive data only in the backend.

2. External script loading without integrity:
bysideWebcare_dhtml_load_script('https://bysa1.[ redacted]/.../custom.purify.min.js');
Risk: Malicious code injection if the external domain is compromised. Recommendation: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) and source validation.

3. Dynamic execution via eval-like:
"js": { "1": "function() { set[redacted]eout(function() { executeTrigger(); }, 5000); }" }
Risk: Arbitrary execution if content is controllable via CMS. Recommendation: Avoid eval and anonymous functions in string; use strict sanitization.

5. Cookies (Security Summary)
Several cookies without security attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) were detected.
Recommendation:
Configure all session cookies with Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict.
Review third-party dependencies ([redacted], [redacted]) for LGPD/GDPR compliance.

6. Network & Administrative Access
Two distinct behaviors were observed:
PluginLogessage: External API access
https://[redacted]/ecom/api/v2/script/initialize?userID=[redacted]
→ Possible third-party endpoint; review external integrity and dependency.
/admin (403 Forbidden)
GET https://www. [redacted]/admin
Status: 403
→ Indicates adequate restraint; without direct exposure.

7. Severity Model (classification used)

8. Mitigation Recommendations (Executive Summary)
Remove sensitive paths from the robots.txt or secure them by authentication.
Add CAA records and revise TLS/HSTS policy.
Validate public uploads and apply MIME and storage policies outside of webroot.
Review DNS/CDN security (MFA, logs, ACLs).
Audit CMS [redacted] and maintain updated versions.
Apply SRI and CSP to external scripts.
Enforce session cookies with secure flags.
Auditar headers de segurança: CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, COOP, COEP.
Perform controlled active tests, upon authorization, for validation of medium risks.

9. Conclusion
Passive survey confirms that the [redacted] domain maintains good overall security posture, with perimeter protection via WAF (Imperva) and valid certificates. However, there are informational and configuration risks that, if combined with authentication or validation failures, can widen the attack surface.
The focus of the next phases should be:
Validação controlada de upload/storage (/sites/default/files/).
Review of consent and third-party scripts.
Strengthening of cookie policy and security headers.
